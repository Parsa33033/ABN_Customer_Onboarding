## How to run

note: to see the h2 database console while running the API application,
go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console


## Use of AI and AutoComplete

this project used gpt to help with:

- autocompletion of lines (mostly comments, javadocs, attribute names, and 
  strings)
- attribute generation for classed (dto, entity, getters/setters)
- setting up application properties
- generation of this very readme file

** Basically all labour non-technical work has been done by AI. **
